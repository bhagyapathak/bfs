About Me
=========

As my email id reads, my name is Adheer Chandravanshi. :)
MAE Alumni from year 2007 Batch of Computer Engg. I got introduced to
the world of Linux Kernel through my Final year project, which was in
the area of Memory Management.
Currently I am working in QLogic Pune as Staff Engineer and I am part
of Linux iSCSI device driver (initiator) team for QLogic Host Bus
Adapters (HBA).

Why I want to be part of this project?
======================================
Mainly to explore the areas of File Systems. And as my job falls in
storage domain, this project will help me understand the stuff on the
other side of my job profile.

What can I offer?
=================
Filesystem is completely new area for me and so I will like to
participate in the design and implementation.

Time
=====
With all the things that I am doing currently, I can spare around 6-8
hours in a week for this project.

About Me
=========

Hello everyone, I am Aniket Meshram. I have completed my Bachelor from MITAOE
and my Masters from PCCOE. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer in a
Software Organization. I am an open source enthusiast. I have been familiar with
Linux since 12th standard. When i was in 11th, i had no idea what this Linux
was. Initially, I started with the Linux source tar file of the kernel and no
GUI. Then later, I got a Ubuntu CD for free. I guess it were the early days of
Ubuntu when it just introduced its GUI, and thus so began my journey with open
source systems.

Why I want to contribute
=========================

I have always been fascinated by the freedom Linux gives to understand low level
systems. Actually it was thanks to Linux i found my interest in the operating
system domain. I totally agree with Rishi. When i started understanding the
Linux file system, there was no way of understanding the concepts from a single
material. I had to refer lot of books to study and work for my ME project. Also
the material was a bit hard to understand at the beginning. I had wished then,
if there had been a dedicated book on file systems.

How can I help
===============

During my ME project i have worked with the Linux ‘ext3’ file system. The
important thing is that this project cleared most of my concepts regarding the
design, implementation, and working of an open source file system. I can thus
contribute in making of the content design and implementation of file system for
the book. I’m not saying that I am an expert, but I take this as an opportunity
to learn more working with you all.

Amount of time per week
========================

Based on the work i have over my shoulders right now, sadly, I can give upto
only 6-7 hours per week, mostly on Saturday's and Sundays.

I would like to have a face to face meeting, if possible, so that we can discuss
the agenda for further actions.

About Me
=========

Its Bhushan.I have completed my be in 2014 and working in Symantec.
Also I have done my BE project in file system domain (EXT4)

Why I want to be part of this project?
======================================

I was working on creating my own experimental file system from few day.I have
done some ground study about it.I also evaluated some tools which will help us.
so I was thinking about to create small file system and write small book on it
from last few months ..
And that's the reason I am in.


What can I offer?
=================

I have done some ground work and having some knowledge of file system , Hence I
can help in any phase of our work.
From writing small shell script to solving Panics.

Time
=====

I can give some time on weekend and once my current pending work finished I can
contribute hour or half and hour daily.

About Me

I am Bhagyashri Pathak.Currently I am working as Senior software Engineer.
I have 4.5 years of exp in System Level Programming & Network Programming.
My enthusiasm to learn full stack and understand it brought  me here.

Email: rishi.b.agrawal@gmail.com 

About Me
========

I am Rishi Agrawal, currently working as an Engineering Lead in a startup. My
passion is teaching and I am opening a training institute which primarily will
be in Computer Science and software development but will later on develop itself
into other areas as well. I have taken few workshops in Linux and Related areas
in colleges as well as corporates.

Why A Book On File Systems
==========================

As far as I know there is no book which deals in this area in the way I am
planning this book. This book will make it easy for the newcomers to get into
file systems and get better in kernel programming.

My Role
=======

I am working on a lot of stuff and thus I will not be working on this as a full
time person, I will just be enabling the team throughout the project. I am
looking for individuals who are motivated enough to take this work and complete
it.

What is available for the team
==============================

This project is big and we all will gain a better understanding of the Linux
system while working on this. I have written a file system myself and that
increased my knowledge n-folds when I did it. The team members can look at
better career prospects, a life long legacy, a contribution to the open source
community.

Email: mailme.gaurav@gmail.com

About Me
=========

I am Gaurav Kukreja. I gained first exposure to Linux Kernel Development during
my Final Year Project in 2010. My project was based on Virtualization and Memory
Management. After completing MS Computer Science in TU Munich, I work in Intel
as a System Engineer. I focus on identifying and analyzing Performance
Bottlenecks in the LTE Modem product.

Motivation
===========

I am selfishly motivated to be a part of this project to learn and improve my
own skills. Rishi's thoughts behind this project are impressive. I believe
students find it difficult, even with all the resource to get started in Linux
Kernel Development. Existing books focus on a theoretical approach, and students
feel buried under all the information. A dedicated guide which focuses on
learning from practice will be immensely helpful. Once they are on the right
path, they will continue to learn and improve.

Contribution
=============

I am not as skilled as other contributors to the project in the field of File
System Development. However, I would like to offer my experience in Technical
Writing. I can contribute by proof-reading. I can also work on developing
exercises while the experts focus on developing the content of the book.

Availability
=============

I am living in Germany and the time difference will be a hindering factor for
communication. I can handle independent tasks such as writing code for examples,
formatting the book in Latex, proof-reading etc. I will be able to contribute
4-6 hours a week.
