Intent
======

The intent is to provdie a write up which would help newbies work with Linux kernel. Presently there is not book which does this.

First few general concepts will be explained like write a module, adding proc interface etc. Then the book will move towards projects small to big. It will cover around 10 projects ranging from file systems to blocklayer to device drivers to networking

A crash tutorial can also be included

The book will help students in making use of module etc. rather than just teaching what are they.

SWOT Analysis
=============

Strengths/Opportunities
=======================
* No book on this topic, closest is "Writing Device Drivers, James Cooperstein".
* Deals with latest and current file systems like ext4 and btrfs.
* Project Wise and Question/Answer approach.
* Will have readers as many as Linux Device Drivers and Understanding the Linux Kernel
* Will serve as a good text book on Linux Kernel Coding.
* Industry level projects make it the best book on the subject.
* Right blend between code and theory.
* Quick and Dirty implementation of the projects make the book reader friendly.
* Exercises and enhancements are suggested for every project with detailed discussion and explanation.



Weakness/Threats
================
* Deals with complex code and concepts.
* Readers will need to be quite comfortable with C programming and system concepts.
* Updating the code with kernel changes.
* Its a big project.
* Code management


=========
Licensing
=========
* Giving the book as free (as in beer) initially and keeping it open for donations will help us focus more on the contents than on the publishing part.
* Printed book on this topic makes less sense as very less amount of the book is theory, the code will be the major chunk of the book.
* Updating the code with freshly released kernel will be not possible in a printed book.
* A lot of college projects are made every year, selected projects can be included in the book, thus helping us in improving the book.

Project Structure
=================
* Introduction
    This section just gives a one paragraph introduction to the project.
    
* Why this project
    Explains why this project is included in the book. Why this project is needed? Who uses the features this project is developing? How the features can be used in production environment.

* What will you learn
    Explains what will the reader learn from the project and why is it important to learn.

* Concepts and Keywords involved
    This just tags the project with the keywords so that the project comes up in glossary and Internet searches.

* Prerequisites
    The list of prerequisites for understanding the project. This section will list a section of must-read references required to proceed with the project.

* Requirement Analysis
    The section gathers the requirements from the project and then categorizes the requirements as must-have, good-to-have, nice-to-have, non-requirements

* Design
    The design will only cater the must-have and good-to-have requirements. This will be the only place where we deal with the design of the project. This section can be sub-divided if the need arises. 

* Implementation
    The code related details will be explained and provided here.

* Testing
    This section deals with the test cases and basic testing. The tests will also be categorized as must-have, good-to-have and nice-to-have. The must-have and good-to-have test cases will be written while the nice to have tests will be left for the user.

* Enhancements
    This section list the enhancements with detailed explanation.

* Exercises
    This section deals with exercises if any.

* References
    Optional references section.
