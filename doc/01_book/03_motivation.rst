While learning the nitty gritties of linux kernel I found that there is not
document which tells the details in the way most of the people understand. I
also saw a lot of requests on kernel new bies for tutorials and documents which
can help programmers and learners in a hands-on way.

This document is just a small attempt for bridging the gap between the hands-on
and theory.

While interacting with students related to Linux and Linux Kernel I found that
they do not have a head start guide which gives a detailed view of the whle
linux system. Moreover there is no such document which is hands-on based,
exercise based. 

I see a lot of questions on mailing lists asking for help in starting with linux
kernel and then getting lost in the wide amount of unstructed information
present every where.
